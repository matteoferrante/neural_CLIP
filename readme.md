## Objective: Cross modality neural alignment.

Why? we could retrieve similar representation across different modalities and mix different dataset to prepare foundation neural models. 

[x] Hybrid models with shared and subjective layers

[x] Retrain subjective MEG

[x] Add NSD

[ ] Add NSD Metrics

[ ] Retrain subjective fMRI THINGS

[ ] Recompute metrics of fMRI THINGS for 27 level classification problems

[ ] Examples of decoding for different modalities

[ ] Example of "encoding" for different modalities both with images and text

[ ] Example of cross-modality conversion

[ ] Write


Detail: Multimodal work with EEG, MEG, fMRI


"Retrieveal" of images -> measure of performances

"Retrieval of different representations"

"Decoding of images using pretrained models"
